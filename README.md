# Installation


1. Clone this repo into a folder called `scripts` in your home folder

2. Create an alias to the dvi file:

        alias dvi='/Users/`whoami`/scripts/driv-vagrant-installer/dvi'

3. Now `dvi` is installed, you can `cd` to your projects folder and run `dvi git@url.org:path/to.git` to install a supported project
